# CyberFortress - Firewall Simulation Documentation
------------------------------------------------
## Overview
The Firewall Simulation module helps simulate the behavior of a firewall in blocking or allowing network traffic. It tests whether specific ports on a target system are accessible or blocked by a firewall.
------------------------------------------------
### Features:
- Simulates whether certain ports are blocked by a firewall.
- Helps identify weak points in the firewall configuration.
- Logs the results of firewall simulation checks.
------------------------------------------------
### How It Works:
The firewall simulation checks if a given port is open or blocked by simulating a connection attempt to that port. If the connection is successful, the port is considered accessible; otherwise, the firewall is blocking it.
------------------------------------------------
### Example Usage:
To test if a particular port is blocked by the firewall, run the `firewall.py` script with the target IP address and the port you want to check:
------------------------------------------------
```bash
python security/firewall.py <target-ip> <port>
------------------------------------------------
Example:
python security/firewall.py 192.168.1.1 80
This command will check if port 80 is open or blocked by the firewall on the target IP 192.168.1.1.
------------------------------------------------
Output:
The output will indicate whether the port is allowed or blocked by the firewall.
Example output:
Testing firewall for 192.168.1.1
Port 80: Allowed
Port 22: Blocked
------------------------------------------------
Best Practices:
Use the firewall simulation regularly to test the security of your network.
Verify firewall configurations to ensure they are blocking unauthorized access.
