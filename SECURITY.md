# **GitHub Security Guide - CyberFortress**
----------------------------------------
## **Project Overview**
CyberFortress is a platform with high-security requirements. GitHub plays a critical role in our development pipeline, and its security must be maintained at the highest level. This guide outlines the security measures required to ensure that all activities within GitHub repositories are performed securely.
----------------------------------------
## **Security Policies**
----------------------------------------
### **Access Control and Authentication**
----------------------------------------
#### **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- Users will be granted access to repositories based on their roles. For instance, developers, administrators, and contributors will have different levels of access to repositories.
- Repositories will be secured to ensure that only authorized personnel can access specific areas of the project.
----------------------------------------
#### **Authentication**
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** All users must enable two-factor authentication (2FA), ensuring that even if login credentials are compromised, access remains protected.
- **GitHub Security Keys:** For sensitive operations (e.g., pushing code to critical repositories), users must authenticate using security keys (hardware-based authenticators or GitHub-supported security tokens).
----------------------------------------
### **Password and Account Security**
----------------------------------------
#### **Password Policy**
- Minimum password length: 40 characters with complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters).
- **Password Rotation:** Passwords must be updated every 30 days. Users are restricted from reusing the last 10 passwords.
----------------------------------------
#### **Password Storage**
- GitHub does not store passwords in plain text. All passwords are securely stored using strong encryption algorithms.
----------------------------------------
#### **Password Violation Detection**
- Users will be immediately notified if a password violation is detected and will be prompted to reset their passwords.
----------------------------------------
### **Repository and Code Security**
----------------------------------------
#### **Code Reviews and Branch Protection**
- Every push and pull request must be reviewed and approved by designated team members before merging into main branches.
- **Branch Protection Rules:** Critical branches (e.g., `main`, `production`) are protected from direct pushes, and code can only be merged via pull requests.
----------------------------------------
#### **Code Scanning and Security Alerts**
- GitHub’s built-in security tools (CodeQL, Dependabot, etc.) automatically scan for vulnerabilities and send security alerts regarding dependencies and code quality.
----------------------------------------
#### **Commit Signing**
- Developers are required to sign commits using GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) keys to ensure the integrity and authenticity of code contributions.
----------------------------------------
### **Data Security**
----------------------------------------
#### **Encryption**
- All sensitive data in repositories (e.g., environment variables, API keys) will be encrypted using AES-256 or other strong encryption standards.
- **Secret Scanning:** GitHub includes secret scanning capabilities to detect sensitive information, such as API keys or passwords, within commits.
----------------------------------------
#### **Data Backup and Storage**
- GitHub provides encrypted backups of repositories and other relevant data. These backups are accessible only by authorized personnel.
----------------------------------------
#### **Data Deletion and Destruction**
- Repositories or any sensitive data can only be deleted with approval from legal authorities. Data deletion follows privacy and compliance standards.
----------------------------------------
### **Network Security**
----------------------------------------
#### **SSH Key Authentication**
- Users and administrators must authenticate using SSH keys to access GitHub repositories. Password-based access is disabled to ensure higher security for actions like pushing or pulling code.
----------------------------------------
#### **Network Traffic Encryption**
- All interactions with GitHub repositories are secured with HTTPS/SSL encryption to protect data in transit.
----------------------------------------
### **Access Control and Identity Management**
----------------------------------------
#### **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
- Users must enable 2FA on their GitHub accounts to perform actions such as pushing code or changing repository settings. 2FA requires both a secure password and an additional authentication method (e.g., OTP or authentication apps).
----------------------------------------
#### **Time-Based Access Control**
- Sensitive GitHub repository actions are restricted to specific hours, preventing unauthorized access outside of working hours.
----------------------------------------
### **Administrator Access**
----------------------------------------
#### **Admin Access Protection**
- Admin accounts must be protected by multi-layered security measures, including requiring secure device login and 2FA for critical operations (e.g., merging code or changing repository settings).
----------------------------------------
### **Monitoring and Incident Response**
----------------------------------------
#### **Audit Logs**
- GitHub’s audit logs track all user activities within repositories, including code changes, access logs, and security alerts. Administrators monitor these logs for suspicious activities.
----------------------------------------
#### **Intrusion Detection**
- Any suspicious or malicious activity is detected in real time, and relevant security teams are notified to address the issue immediately.
----------------------------------------
### **Compliance and Legal Requirements**
----------------------------------------
#### **Data Anonymization**
- Personal data will only be retained when legally required. Any data that isn’t legally necessary will be anonymized.
----------------------------------------
#### **Legal Compliance**
- All data management and repository activities comply with relevant privacy laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), and regular security audits are performed to ensure compliance.
----------------------------------------
## **Conclusion**
CyberFortress has implemented comprehensive security measures for all GitHub repositories to ensure that code, data, and user interactions remain secure. These policies, combined with GitHub's inherent security tools and regular audits, provide a robust framework for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of the CyberFortress project.

## Security Testing Rules
CyberFortress Security Testing Rules

## General Rules
Do Not Perform Tests in the Production EnvironmentAlways use the designated staging environment or forks of the project for security testing. Production environments should never be used for security testing to avoid disrupting real users or operations.
Use Authorized Testing Tools and FrameworksOnly use authorized and officially approved tools for security testing. Unauthorized or third-party tools can trigger IP bans or compromise the integrity of the system.
Do Not Disrupt Operations or User DataEnsure that your security tests do not interfere with the normal operations of the project, especially regarding user data. Any malicious or harmful activities are strictly prohibited and will lead to legal actions.

## Additional Considerations
Testing Process IntegritySecurity tests should always be planned, scheduled, and communicated to relevant teams. Unauthorized testing or unscheduled activities can cause issues for the platform’s security.
Reporting VulnerabilitiesIf a vulnerability is found, it should be reported immediately to the security team through the proper channels. Public disclosure of any vulnerability before resolution is strictly prohibited.
Scope of TestingOnly test the parts of the system explicitly authorized by the project security policies. Do not attempt to breach or test areas outside the agreed scope.
By following these security test rules, CyberFortress ensures the integrity of the platform and the safety of its users while minimizing the risk of data breaches and other security incidents.

## Penalties for Violations
Any attempt to violate the terms of this policy or to intentionally compromise the project’s security will result in:
- **Immediate ban from this repository**.
- **Notification of relevant authorities** if laws are violated.
- **Permanent disqualification** from contributing to this or any related projects.
