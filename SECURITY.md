# CyberFortress Security Guide
----------------------------------------
## About the Project
### CyberFortress is a platform with high security requirements. This project is only accessible to authorized users, authorities, and system administrators. Security is paramount, and this project ensures the protection of all system components at the highest level. Strict security measures are applied for platform access, with thorough validation at every step.
----------------------------------------
Security Policies
1. Access Control and Authentication:
Content Access: To perform any action on the platform, restrictions will be applied based on the user’s role and authorization level. Access will be granted only to authorized personnel.
----------------------------------------
Authentication:
3FA (Three-Factor Authentication): Authentication will consist of:
Password: Username and password combination, requiring a minimum of 40 characters and a complex character set.
Biometric Data: Biometric authentication methods such as fingerprint or facial recognition, depending on the device and environment.
Hardware-Based Token: The user will authenticate with a security key (USB security key or hardware-based authenticator) attached to the device.
Time-Based Access Restrictions: The system will apply time-based access restrictions, meaning user access will only be active during specific time windows, and access rights will be automatically disabled outside those times.

Administrator Access: Admin accounts will only be accessible with multi-layered security measures, requiring secure device login for further protection.
----------------------------------------
2. Password Policy:
Password Length: All users and system administrators must have passwords that are a minimum of 40 characters long. Longer passwords are recommended for extra security. Password complexity is also strictly monitored.

Password Character Set: Passwords must include the following character types:
Uppercase letters (A-Z)
Lowercase letters (a-z)
Numbers (0-9)
Special characters (e.g., !@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:'",.<>?/~)
Whitespace characters are also required.

Password Changes: Passwords must be changed every 30 days. Users cannot reuse any of their previous 10 passwords. Password changes will be automatically tracked with password validity durations and security requirements.

Password Storage: Passwords will never be stored as plain text. All passwords will be stored using the strongest encryption algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2, scrypt) with salts and hashing methods to ensure security.

Password Violation Detection: If a password violation is detected, users will be notified immediately, and they will be required to reset their passwords.
----------------------------------------
3. Data Security
Data Encryption:
All data will be protected using AES-256 bit encryption during both storage and transmission.
Encryption keys will be rotated at regular intervals and stored securely.

Data Backup:
Daily backups will be stored encrypted and will only be accessible by authorized users.
Backup data will be kept in offline and offsite storage environments for extra security.

Data Deletion and Destruction:
Data deletion will be conducted according to privacy and legal requirements. Any user data or log entries can only be deleted with approval from legal authorities.
Data deletion will be performed using data destruction protocols, ensuring compliance with privacy standards.
Data Anonymization: User data will be anonymized, and personally identifiable information will be retained only when legally required.
----------------------------------------
4. Network Security
Encryption Protocols: All network communication within the platform will be secured using SSL/TLS encryption protocols.
VPN Usage: All traffic for employees, system administrators, and authorized users will be routed through a secure VPN (Virtual Private Network).
Advanced Network Monitoring: Network activities will be monitored and analyzed 24/7 by a centralized monitoring system. Anomaly detection techniques will be used, incorporating AI and machine learning.
Internal and External Firewalls: The platform will be protected with advanced firewalls and IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems), allowing access only from specific IP addresses and ports.
DDoS Protection: The platform will be protected against Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. Advanced security services will monitor incoming traffic and block suspicious activities in real time.
----------------------------------------
5. Network Monitoring and Security Firewalls
Advanced Monitoring Systems: All network activities will be monitored by security experts, with any unusual activity detected and immediately addressed.
Firewall and Intrusion Detection Systems: Both internal and external systems will be protected with advanced IDS/IPS tools. Any attack attempts will be immediately blocked and the relevant personnel will be notified.
Access Control and Identity Management
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Users will be assigned specific roles based on their responsibilities, and all actions within the platform will be controlled based on security and confidentiality requirements.
Time-Based Access Control: User access rights will be active only during specific hours. For instance, access will only be allowed during working hours.
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Users will be required to use both a secure password and an additional authentication method, such as OTP (One-Time Password) or authentication applications for extra security.
----------------------------------------
## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please follow these strict steps:

1. **DO NOT** publicly disclose the vulnerability. Any public sharing of vulnerabilities without following the reporting process will result in a ban from contributing to this project.
2. Send an email to **** with the subject line: `[SECURITY ISSUE]`.
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability, including:
    - Steps to reproduce the issue.
    - Potential impact on the system.
    - Any potential fixes or workarounds.
4. If the issue is critical, mark the email as "URGENT."

We aim to respond to all security issues within **3 hours** and resolve critical vulnerabilities within **7 days** of confirmation.

## Responsible Disclosure Policy

We encourage responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities. Please adhere to the following guidelines:
- **Do not exploit the vulnerability**. Exploiting discovered vulnerabilities is strictly prohibited.
- Provide the development team adequate time to address the issue before making any public statements.
- Collaborate with the team during the fix implementation phase.

Failure to follow these guidelines may result in legal actions depending on the nature and severity of the breach.

## Security Contact
For urgent or critical security matters, contact the following individual directly:
- **X99874**  
  Security Lead  
  Email: ****  
  Phone: ****

## Security Testing Rules

Security testing on this project must follow these rules:
1. **Do not perform tests on the production environment.** Use the designated staging environment or forks of the project.
2. **Use authorized tools and frameworks** for testing. Unauthorized tools may result in IP bans.
3. **Do not disrupt the project’s operations or user data.** Intentional harm is not tolerated and may result in legal actions.

## Penalties for Violations
Any attempt to violate the terms of this policy or to intentionally compromise the project’s security will result in:
- **Immediate ban from this repository**.
- **Notification of relevant authorities** if laws are violated.
- **Permanent disqualification** from contributing to this or any related projects.
